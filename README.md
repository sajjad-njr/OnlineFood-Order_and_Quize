# About us & project descriptions
 
First of all, I did this project when I was the first semester so please ignore the coding structure or way of writing code.

In this project, we ( 4 friends ) covered mainly two parts 
1. Oderning Food System with c console project
2. Entertainment ( Quiz )

In the order food system, we showed the menu as like a restaurant that considering our native restaurant. People can see the menu and if the user wants then the user can order something. 

Entertainment option: These options we added for the reason when people order something it took some time for delivery. In the meantime, users can play the quiz or want to know some information about the Sylhet tour place.
